xtermStyle -- Terminal output coloring in R
==========
This library is developed as a resource allowing other packages to color their terminal output.
It was originally created for the [`inspectr`](https://github.com/backlin/inspectr) package
(previously known as `dataview`, although not yet officially renamed), but since it provides a general service I though it just as well to release it on its own.

Some time after the creatation of `xtermStyle`, the [`crayon`](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/crayon) package appeared on GitHub.
Both `xtermStyle` and `crayon` do pretty much exactly the same thing but differs in flavour, so pick the one you fancy.
