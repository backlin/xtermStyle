Description: Text formatting in xterm and ansi terminals using escape sequences.
  Supports colors and various font styles. It began as a standalone version of 
  the 'xterm256' package by Romain Francois since that package is interwoven
  with the syntax highlighting package 'highlight' but has been developed in
  another direction since then.
  For some more sophisticated examples of this package functionality check out
  the 'dataview' package as that was the very reason 'xtermStyle' came into
  existence. However as 'xtermStyle' can be used independently they were
  released separately.
